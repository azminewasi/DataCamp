    "Classification reports and confusion matrices are great methods to quantitatively evaluate model performance, while ROC curves provide a way to visually evaluate models. As Hugo demonstrated in the video, most classifiers in scikit-learn have a .predict_proba() method which returns the probability of a given sample being in a particular class. Having built a logistic regression model, you'll now evaluate its performance by plotting an ROC curve. In doing so, you'll make use of the .predict_proba() method and become familiar with its functionality.\n",

    "Here, you'll continue working with the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset. The classifier has already been fit to the training data and is available as logreg.\n",
