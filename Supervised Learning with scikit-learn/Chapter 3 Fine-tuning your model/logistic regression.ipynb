    "Building a logistic regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to build your first logistic regression model! As Hugo showed in the video, scikit-learn makes it very easy to try different models, since the Train-Test-Split/Instantiate/Fit/Predict paradigm applies to all classifiers and regressors - which are known in scikit-learn as 'estimators'. You'll see this now for yourself as you train a logistic regression model on exactly the same data as in the previous exercise. Will it outperform k-NN? There's only one way to find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature and target variable arrays X and y have been pre-loaded, and train_test_split has been imported for you from sklearn.model_selection.\n",
