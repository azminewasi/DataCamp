SELECT DISTINCT
Often your results will include many duplicate values. If you want to select all the unique values from a column, you can use the DISTINCT keyword.

This might be useful if, for example, you're interested in knowing which languages are represented in the films table:

SELECT DISTINCT language
FROM films;
Remember, you can check out the data in the tables by clicking on the table name!

Practice with COUNT
As you've seen, COUNT(*) tells you how many rows are in a table. However, if you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can call COUNT() on just that column.

For example, to count the number of birth dates present in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(birthdate)
FROM people;
It's also common to combine COUNT() with DISTINCT to count the number of distinct values in a column.

For example, this query counts the number of distinct birth dates contained in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)
FROM people;
Let's get some practice with COUNT()!
