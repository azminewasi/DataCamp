Comparing models
Compare k nearest neighbors classifiers with k=1 and k=5 on the handwritten digits data set, which is already loaded into the variables X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test. You can set k with the n_neighbors parameter when creating the KNeighborsClassifier object, which is also already imported into the environment.
